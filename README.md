ImageForge is a powerful web application that allows you to **batch-generate series of visually consistent images using AI, driven by your structured data**. Simply provide your data in CSV or TSV format, define your consistency rules and variations, and let the AI create unique images for each data row.

It's perfect for content creators, marketers, designers, and anyone who needs to produce multiple related images efficiently while maintaining a cohesive visual style.

## Key Features

*   **Batch Image Generation:** Create hundreds of images from a single data source (CSV or TSV file/text).
*   **Data-Driven Variations:** Each row in your data file dictates the unique elements of an image.
*   **Modular Prompting System:**
    *   **Start Prompt (Consistency Rules):** Define global styles, recurring characters/logos, color palettes, resolutions, and negative prompts that apply to all images.
    *   **End Prompt (Reinforcement):** Add final instructions to further ensure consistency.
*   **Prompt Templates:** Get started quickly with pre-defined templates for common use cases:
    *   YouTube Thumbnails
    *   Comic Book Panels
    *   Product Showcase Images
    *   Children's Story Illustrations
    *   Project Roadmap Visuals (Tech/Blockchain)
    *   2D Game Tile Sprites
    *   Character Asset Sets (NFT Style)
    *   Abstract Backgrounds/Wallpapers
*   **Reference Image Support:** Upload an image (character, logo, style guide) to guide the AI and improve visual consistency.
*   **Customizable AI Settings:**
    *   Optionally use your own Google AI API Key.
    *   Set a delay between image generations to manage API rate limits.
*   **Interactive Image Gallery:** View all your generated images in one place.
*   **Easy Download:** Download individual images. Filenames are intelligently generated based on your input data for better organization.

## What Can You Create?

ImageForge is versatile! Here are some examples of what you can generate:

*   **YouTube Thumbnails:** Create engaging, branded thumbnails for all your videos.
*   **Comic Book Panels:** Generate sequential art with consistent characters and art styles.
*   **Product Visuals:** Produce a set of images showcasing different product variations or features.
*   **Story Illustrations:** Illustrate scenes for a children's book with a consistent character.
*   **Project Roadmap Visuals:** Design sleek, futuristic visuals for each stage of your tech or crypto project roadmap.
*   **2D Game Assets:** Create tileable surface sprites (grass, stone, water) for your game.
*   **Character Collections (NFT Style):** Generate variations of a base character with different traits for PFP collections.
*   **Abstract Backgrounds:** Design a series of aesthetic wallpapers or digital backdrops.
*   And much more â€“ if you can define it with data, you can likely generate it!

## Who Is This For?

*   **Content Creators:** YouTubers, social media managers, bloggers needing consistent visuals.
*   **Marketers & Advertisers:** For creating visuals for campaigns, A/B testing, and product promotions.
*   **Designers & Illustrators:** As an ideation tool and for batch production of visual assets.
*   **Storytellers & Writers:** For visualizing narratives, characters, and storyboards.
*   **Game Developers:** For generating 2D game assets like tiles and sprites.
*   **Project Managers & Entrepreneurs:** For creating visually appealing roadmap presentations or pitch deck elements.
*   **Anyone who needs to create multiple, thematically linked images** where data-driven variation and stylistic consistency are key.

## How to Use ImageForge

1.  **Select a Prompt Template (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Choose a template from the "Prompt Template" dropdown (e.g., "YouTube Thumbnails"). This will pre-fill the `Start Prompt`, `Data Input` text area, and `End Prompt` fields with a relevant example. You can then customize these.

2.  **Configure the "Start Prompt (Consistency Rules)":**
    *   This is crucial for visual consistency. Define your art style, any recurring characters or logos (describe them in detail!), color palettes, desired resolution, and negative prompts (things to avoid). This text will be placed *before* the data from each row of your CSV/TSV.

3.  **Provide Your Data (CSV or TSV format):**
    *   **Option A: Paste Data:** Paste your data directly into the "Data Input (CSV or TSV format) - Text Area".
        *   The first line **must** be your column headers (e.g., `Video_Title_Concept,Main_Visual_Element`).
        *   Subsequent lines are your data rows, with values separated by commas (for CSV) or tabs (for TSV).
    *   **Option B: Upload File:** Click "Choose File" under "Upload Data File" and select your `.csv` or `.tsv` file.
        *   If a file is uploaded, its content will be used *instead* of the text area.
        *   The uploaded file also needs a header row.

4.  **Configure the "End Prompt (Reinforce Consistency)":**
    *   Add text that will be placed *after* the data from each row. This is useful for reinforcing consistency rules (e.g., "Ensure the image strictly adheres to the character design and art style defined in the start prompt.").

5.  **Upload a Reference Image (Optional):**
    *   If you have a specific visual style, character design, or logo you want the AI to reference, upload it here. This significantly helps in achieving consistency.

6.  **Set Google AI API Key (Optional):**
    *   If you have your own Google AI API key and wish to use it, enter it here. Otherwise, the application will try to use a pre-configured server-side key (if available).

7.  **Set Delay Between Generations (Optional):**
    *   Choose a delay (e.g., 10 seconds, 1 minute) to wait between generating each image. This can be helpful for managing API rate limits or if you're generating a very large batch.

8.  **Click "Generate Images":**
    *   The application will process each row of your data, combine it with your start and end prompts, and generate an image.
    *   You'll see progress messages indicating which image is currently being generated.

9.  **View & Download Generated Images:**
    *   As images are generated, they will appear in the "Generated Images" gallery on the right.
    *   Each image card will show a preview and a "Download" button.
    *   The downloaded filename will be based on key information from your data (like a title or ID column) for easier organization.

## Tips for Best Results

*   **Be Specific in Your Prompts:** The more detail you provide in your `Start Prompt` about art style, characters, colors, and what to avoid, the better and more consistent your results will be.
*   **Leverage the Reference Image:** For character consistency or specific styles, a good reference image is invaluable.
*   **Start with Templates:** Use the provided templates as a starting point and adapt them to your needs. Pay attention to how they structure the prompts and data.
*   **Iterate and Experiment:** AI image generation can sometimes require a bit of trial and error. Don't be afraid to tweak your prompts and data to achieve your desired outcome.
*   **Understand Text Generation Limitations:** Current AI image models are primarily visual. While they can sometimes render simple text, they are not reliable for large blocks of precise text. For text-heavy visuals like pitch decks or detailed infographics, generate the background/visual elements with ImageForge and add text using a dedicated design or presentation tool.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

*   **"My images look inconsistent."**
    *   **Solution:** Make your `Start Prompt` (Consistency Rules) much more detailed. Specify exact colors, character features, art style elements, and what *not* to do (negative prompts). Use a clear `Reference Image` if possible.
*   **"The AI isn't generating text correctly in the images."**
    *   **Solution:** This is a known limitation of current image generation models. They are best at visuals. Prompt for *space* for text or visual elements that *suggest* text. Add your actual text content using tools like Canva, PowerPoint, Figma, etc., after generating the base image with ImageForge.
*   **"I'm getting errors during generation."**
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Check if your Google AI API Key (if provided) is correct and has billing enabled.
        *   Ensure your prompts are clear and not ambiguous.
        *   Verify your CSV/TSV data format is correct (headers, consistent columns).
        *   The AI model has safety filters that might block certain prompts or reference images. Try rephrasing or using a different reference.
*   **"How is the filename for downloaded images determined?"**
    *   ImageForge tries to use a relevant piece of data from your input row (e.g., `Tile_Name`, `Character_ID`, `Stage_Title`, `Video_Title_Concept`, or the value from the first column) to create a helpful base for the filename.
